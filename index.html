	<p class="paragraph">My name is Kristine Luangkhot. I was born on December 8, 1998 in Toronto, Ontario. Alongside my grandparents, my mom immigrated from Laos to Toronto, Canada in 1984 and my entire family has lived here ever since. Currently, most of my family lives in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA) in the City of Vaughan. This is where I grew up and currently live. Compared to other countries Laos is fairly small, with a population of 7 million people in 2020 (United Nations). Due to its small size, not many people know where Laos is when I first tell them my family is from there. Therefore, I have included a simple map for your reference. The map includes a marker on the city where my family is from; Vientiane, Laos. The Lao community in Toronto and the GTA is even smaller, with everyone knowing (almost) everyone. I grew up attending the temple every Sunday and my grandma is known to play a big part in organizing events and prayers at the temple.</p>
	<p class="paragraph">I attended Maple High School in Vaughan then attended the University of Toronto (UofT). I graduated from UofT in June 2020, completing a double major in Environmental Science and Environmental Geography with a minor in Urban Studies. The flexibility of my degrees gave me the opportunity to explore different fields of geography, which led me to taking two Geographic Information and Mapping courses taught by Professor Don Boyes. As a result, I became interested in map making and design. Unfortuneately, there was no opportunity to major or minor in GIS at UofT. That's why I decided to look at GIS college programs and ended up applying to the Geographic Information Systems - Applications Specialist at Fleming College. I am currently enrolled in this program and expect to graduate in ten months (December 2021).</p>

	<h3 class="subheader">Family</h3>
	<p class="fullparagraph">Many people tell me I have a big family on my mom's side. My grandma has 8 kids, which means I have 3 aunts and 4 uncles. I also have 7 first cousins and 1 first-cousin-once-removed. In other words, one of my cousin's has a baby. I would say I'm fairly close to my family as in a pre-COVID world we got together as often as we could and I talk to my cousins on a daily basis. My immediate family consists of my mom, my brother and I (pictured below). It has been us three for as long as I can remember. My brother is one of my best friends as our bedrooms have been right beside each other our entire lives and we walk in to each other's rooms any time we want to talk. Whether it be about school, family, friendships or relationships, I know my brother is there to listen to me. I am lucky to have my family so close to me physically and emotionally.</p>

	<h4 class="subheader">Hobbies</h4>
	<p class="fullparagraph">Growing up, I played a lot of sports and loved being outside. As a kid, I would always get in trouble for staying in the backyard too long or riding my bike around the neighbourhood without adult supervision. I played basketball all throughout elementary and high school, flag football in high school and intramural ultimate frisbee in university. Sports were a way for me to exercise without being annoyed at the prospect of exercising. I never enjoyed going to the gym and running on the treadmill or lifting weights in isolation. Even though I do not play any organized sports now, I still enjoy watching basketball and soccer.</p>

	<p class="fullparagraph">Another hobby of mine is music production. Every time I listen to a song the first thing I notice is the beat or production quality. I'm constantly listening to music from all genres and trying to decipher the instruments and production techniques used. In my free time (not that I have much of it in college) I enjoy watching Ableton tutorials in an effort to learn how to produce music. Ableton Live is software for music production and is commonly used to compose, record, arrange, mix, and master songs.</p>

	<h5 class="subheader">Notable Trip: Iceland</h5>

	<p class="paragraph">In December 2019, my girlfriend and I spontaneously decided to visit Iceland for a week. Our friends and family thought it was odd that we were leaving the harsh Canadian winter to go to an even harsher winter in Iceland, but I do not regret our decision at all. We stayed in the city of Reykjavik and took bus tours to different attractions outside of the city. We got to hike to the top of a waterwall, go to the infamous black sand beach, see the Big Dipper among many other stars and constellations, witness the Northern Lights and drink a lot of delicious hot chocolate. Being born in December, I suppose I was bound to love the cold and snow no matter where I went. We loved Iceland so much that we constantly talk about moving there.</p>

	<p class="centerparagraph">One thing I was not prepared for was the lack of daylight during the winter. We would only get about four hours of sunlight each day, with the sun rising at 11:30am and setting at 3:30pm. Our vacation also happened to land on the longest night of the year, where we only got two hours of sunlight that day. Living in Canada my entire life, I knew the sun would set early in the winter but I never expected the sun to set at 3:30pm! The only good thing to come out of this lack of daylight was the beautiful sunset pictures I got to take almost every afternoon. I've seen some beautiful sunsets in Canada, but nothing compared to the sunsets I saw in Iceland.</p>
